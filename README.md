Hi, I’m Subin Kumar 👋, also known as @hacragon in the cyber world. The dragon symbolizes strength, wisdom, and a touch of the mystical, reflecting my powerful and relentless approach to cybersecurity. Like a legendary dragon, I wield standout skills and a sharp eye 🧐 to uncover hidden vulnerabilities and tackle bugs with determination 🔐. I’m a passionate cybersecurity enthusiast with a knack for discovering critical flaws and a relentless drive for bug hunting. My journey has earned me spots in several Halls of Fame 🏆 and bounty rewards 💰—enough to fuel my coffee addiction ☕.

My daily routine? Chasing bugs like they’re rare Pokémon 🕵️‍♂️ and occasionally doing a victory dance when I find one. With a Master’s in Cyber Security 🎓 and hands-on experience from internships, I’ve designed CTF challenges for military hackathons 🛡️ and led projects deep into web application security 💻. Always eager for the next challenge, I’m committed to staying ahead in the ever-evolving field of cybersecurity 🚀. As I continue my journey, I’m excited to discover new vulnerabilities, share my expertise with the community 🌐, and, of course, keep hunting for that next big find.

Happy hacking! (And if you see me staring at code for hours, it’s probably love. 🛠️)
