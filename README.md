Hi, I’m Subin Kumar 👋, also known as @hacragon in the cyber world. The dragon symbolizes strength, wisdom, and a bit of mystery — just like my approach to cybersecurity. Like a legendary dragon, I wield standout sharp skills and a keen eye 🧐. I’m all about finding hidden vulnerabilities and tackling bugs with determination 🔐.

I’m passionate about cybersecurity and love discovering critical flaws, with a relentless drive for bug hunting. My journey has earned me spots in several Halls of Fame 🏆 and bounty rewards 💰—enough to fuel my coffee addiction ☕.

My daily routine? Chasing bugs like they’re rare Pokémon 🕵️‍♂️ and occasionally doing a victory dance when I find one. With a Master’s in Cyber Security 🎓 and hands-on experience from internships, I’ve designed CTF challenges for military hackathons 🛡️ and explored the depths of web application security 💻. 

As I continue my journey, I’m excited to discover new vulnerabilities, share my expertise with the community 🌐, and, of course, keep hunting for that next big find.

Happy hacking! (And if you see me staring at code for hours, it’s probably love. 🛠️)
